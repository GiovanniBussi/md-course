1. Modify the simplemd code in order to simulate a polymer with a FENE potential. To this aim add a repulsive potential in the form
`-0.5*k*R0*R0*log(1-distance*distance/(R0*R0))`;
on pairs of consecutive atoms, where k=30 and R0=1.5 (LJ units). Notice that you should compute the derivative in order to add the proper force.
2. Run a simulation at temperature T=0.722 using the following initial coordinates:
```
10
100 100 100
Ar 0 0 0
Ar 0 0 1
Ar 0 0 2
Ar 0 0 3
Ar 0 0 4
Ar 0 0 5
Ar 0 0 6
Ar 0 0 7
Ar 0 0 8
Ar 0 0 9
```
3. Compute the average gyration radius of the polymer RGYR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_gyration)
4. Modify the code in order to add a term to the potential linear in RGYR. Be careful when computing the derivatives of RGYR with respect to atomic positions
5. Find the Lagrangian multiplier required to enforce an average RGYR=2.5. You can either proceed by trial and error or adjust the Lagrangian multiplier during the simulation.
