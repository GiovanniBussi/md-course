1. Download MD program

You can download the source code here: http://giovannibussi.github.io/simplemd/

In directory src/ you find the fortran 90 source code. Remember to edit the "compile" script setting the correct name for your fortran compiler

In directory cpp/ you find the C version which might be easy to understand if you have no fortran knowledge.

In directory xyz/ you find a template input file (xyz/in) and several possible initial coordinates (xyz/*.xyz)


2. Compile the MD program

Use the script src/compile to produce a src/simplemd.x executable. It can then be used as src/simplemd.x < in


3. Plotting results

When simplemd.x runs it produces a "energies.dat" file. Meaning of columns is explained in src/README. To plot results with gnuplot you can do e.g.

$ gnuplot

gnuplot> plot "energies.dat" using 2:4

(this is plotting column 4 as a function of column 2)


4. Verify energy conservation

Run short simulations starting from the crystal structure. Remember that initial potential energy is the minimal one, whereas kinetic energy is initialized according to the temperature in the input file (in LJ units).

A. Check energy conservation (drift and fluctuations) for different values of the time step (e.g. timestep=0.0001, 0.001, 0.01)

B. Find the maximum time step allowed for this system

C. Repeat with different values of the temperature (e.g. T=0.01, T=0.1, T=1)

5. Generate crystal structures with a different number of atoms. You can do it with the following command (from the xyz/ directory):

./lattice 1 > crystal1.xyz

./lattice 2 > crystal2.xyz

etc

The command "./lattice N" will generate an crystal structure with N*N*N*4 atoms. How do energy drift, energy fluctuation, and maximum allowed timestep depend on size of the system?
